# GamemodeSwitcherLP
Serverside mod for switching gamemodes with luckperms support.
##
Now you can finally control your player's ability to change gamemodes without /op! \
Also have some QoL features!

*Currently you can't change other player's gamemode with these commands, but I will add it if there are actually some downloads.
## Features:
### Added:
added commands /gm s/c/sp/a /gms /gmc /gmsp /gm - change gamemodes. \
added command /suicide - no comment. \
added commands /spec /s - the first time you run it will change your gamemode to spectator, the second time you run it will teleport you back to your starting location then change back your gamemode. \
added permission for /me and /say - you can use this to toggle player's ability to run /me and/or /say. \
added speed limiter for players - you can control player's max speed with permissions. \
added command /speedlimit - toggles or sets arguments for speed limiter(blocks per second, notify console). \
added notification for server list ping - you can see who are refreshing their server lists :D. \
